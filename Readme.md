# App Journey #1

In this repository i'm going to record my entire process of creating a webb app for the start2impact node.js project, follow me in this journey! 

## Rules

I'll try to commit every day with more data possibile, like hour spent, wich source i've used, how far the code went and etcetera etcetera. 

## The Project

The project is pretty simple, i have to build a Node.js app whic helps to report polluted place near your geolocalization. Isn't required a UI, but is required to build APIs, make possible photo upload to show the pollution and upload the coords.

# Day 1

**Date:** 05 March
i've started to lay down a plan for the app, initialized folder, installed some packages and made a basic routing. 

I've studied how to *design schemas* in MongoDB and i leave you two usefull resource:
[üìù - 6 Thumb Rules for Schema Design](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/6-rules-of-thumb-for-mongodb-schema-design-part-1)

Then i sketched out the first sample of schemas that you can find in sample.js and i've searched how to find the nearest location in using the coords of cites and photos, stackoverflow gave me an [hint!](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36534879/how-to-find-data-of-nearest-location-from-mongodb-collection-using-mongoose)
